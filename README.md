# emission-absorption-lines

First run download_spectra.py to download the spectra from https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/COSMOS/spectra/deimos/spec1d_fits

Change paths as necessary. 

Then, run gen_spectra.py to store the data in the databases. 

Finally, run main.py. 
main.py takes in an input list of spectra ID and outputs the emmission/absorption lines found.
